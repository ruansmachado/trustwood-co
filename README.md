## In the main page has:
+ Slider with generic images;
+ Brief information about the current office;
+ Informations about the first office, location and awards
+ Informations about the services that this firm offers;
+ A newsletters with a <a href="https://sweetalert2.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SweetAlert2</a> feature;
+ And a footer with links. Some of them has a "page under construction" alert, for example the "Live chat" link;

## This features are in developing:
+ Responsive for mobile;
